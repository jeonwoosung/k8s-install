Step 1. Setup Yum repository
Execute the following command to enable MySQL yum repository on CentOS:

    rpm -Uvh https://repo.mysql.com/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
Step 2. Install MySQL 8 Community Server
Since the MySQL yum repository has multiple repositories configuration for multiple MySQL versions, you need to disable all repositories in mysql repo file:

    sed -i 's/enabled=1/enabled=0/' /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo
And execute the following command to install MySQL 8:

    yum --enablerepo=mysql80-community install -y mysql-community-server
Step 3. Start MySQL Service
Use this command to start mysql service:

    service mysqld start
Step 4. Show the default password for root user
When you install MySQL 8.0, the root user account is granted a temporary password. To show the password of the root user account, you use this command:

    grep "A temporary password" /var/log/mysqld.log
Here is the output:

[Note] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: hjkygMukj5+t783


     root@localhost: d)Iwg)_,K70A


     ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'qwerASDF12#$';
